### 💫 About Me:
I am a computer science student in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, currentnly on my third year. I am very passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science and statistics. I am particularly interested in federated learning, fairness and bias in AI and in computational statistics methods. I would like to gain more experience and experitse on AI and machine learning, get involved in relevant courses, summer schools, conferences and projects! 

Moreover, as a Spacedot member, I was working on the ADCS subsystem, as the testing lead. You can checkout more about this project on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/eleannap).

In my free time I enjoy playing basketball and the piano.
